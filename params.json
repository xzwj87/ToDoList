In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTodo List is mainly developed by TianXing Li(@nex3z), ZhanNeng Wang(@runningforlife)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nif you have any questions or advices, please contact wlh2119@gmail.com\r\n",
